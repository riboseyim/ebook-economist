# 自由迁徙：改革的障碍

**政府谨慎的改革一个引起社会分裂的制度**

2015/12/19 | 北京

社会控制的一些基础制度在开始瓦解。
首先受到瞩目的是，10月份宣布放宽严苛的计划生育限制。
现在则轮到人口登记领域—户口制度，一项决定一个人是否能在城市享受公共服务－持有农村户口的人是被排除在外的。

12月12日，中国政府通过官方媒体宣布了户口政策的重大调整，一项在中国城市造成巨大社会分裂、限制劳动者自由迁徙的制度。
虽然这项制度引起激烈的冲突，但是，它将继续长期存在。

随着对计划生育政策的调整（现在所有夫妻将被允许生育两个小孩），这些年户籍制度的改革勉强进行了一半。
他们将允许候鸟人群申请包含一些城市户口优惠的特别居住证（一本证明家庭成员登记信息的小册子）。
如果城市户口类似于护照的话，居住证就像是绿卡一样。

据介绍，移民在一个城市生活六个月以上，将被允许申请居住证，只需要出示劳动合同或者租赁证明。
居住证将使得移民可以在居住地享受国家医疗保险，他们的孩子将可以入读当地的公立学校直到15岁。
它同样使得一些官僚程序变得更简单，例如购车。这些改革之前已经在一些城市试点。现在将被推广到全国范围。
 
对那些有需求的人们来说，这项政策变化将带来两大主要好处。
7000万农村留守儿童中的一部分，将有条件和他们的移民父母一起生活。同时，这项政策使得移民可以享受城市公共服务，而不必失去农村户口的主要益处：分配一小块土地的权利。
据2010年中国社科院的一份调查报告显示，90%的移民不希望改变他们的户口，因为他们担心失去这些土地权益。


 各阶层的统计数字


尽管二孩正常已经出台，还是于公众预期有一些差距。
大多数移民是临时雇员。他们很难持有任何劳动、租赁合同。如果要使改革，一定程度上依赖于财政资金。
政府已经于近期决定增加公立学校预算。理论上，配套资金需要覆盖政策实施以后带来的小学生人数增长。但是公共服务系统是否能够承受，则是从没经受测试的。


还有一些其他要点。
50万－100万人口城市，申请者需要参加政府的社会保险三年以上。
100万－500万人口城市，则需要至少5年以上。
同时这项改革并不包括超大城市。这些城市自己制定政策。


相似的问题也存在于1300万没有户口的人身上。
这意味着他们无法完成需要出示身份证的所有事情：乘坐火车、飞机、申请护照。
这些人中的60%在中国常被称为“黑孩”—违反独生子女政策而出生。
12月9日，习近平主席宣布那些没有户口的人群将获得合法身份。但是现在还不清楚，他们将获得哪种类型的户口，以及是否需要缴纳违反计划生育政策的罚款。

中国政府宣布到2010年1亿农村移民有望获得城市户口（现在有2亿5千万农村移民生活在城市区域）
这个口号看起来不大可能实现。
特别是那些特大城市，
按照提出改革方案的北京市政府的标准，更换户口将变得更加艰难：首都优先需要的是精英人群（1年出租车消费达10万元，远比那些普通劳动者一年的收入还多）。

户口政策开始于1950年代，它被设计用于阻止移民潮可能引起的城市混乱。
从1990年代开始，中国已经依赖移民来供应廉价劳动力，以支持蓬勃发展的制造业。
但是政府依然希望控制劳动人口流动，它担心不受控制的人口流动，特别是涌入大城市以后，可能引起城市中产阶级的强烈不满，他们担心公共服务人满为患。
新的户口制度改革，主要被设计用来从沿海大城市向内陆小城市驱赶移民。
左修理，一位家庭保洁工人，已经在北京生活超过10年，月收入2500元，他并不确定是否会去申请城市户口。
“我当然想要北京户口啦，”他说。“但是对我来说这是不可能的。”

Internal migration
Shifting barriers
The government reforms a socially divisive system, warily
Dec 19th 2015  | BEIJING | From the print edition


THE pillars of social control are flaking at the edges. First came the relaxation in October of draconian family-planning restrictions. Now it is the turn of the household-registration, or hukou, system, which determines whether a person may enjoy subsidised public services in urban areas—rural hukou holders are excluded. On December 12th the government announced what state media trumpeted as the biggest shake-up in decades of the hukou policy, which has aggravated a huge social divide in China’s cities and curbed the free flow of labour. The pernicious impact of the system, however, will long persist.

As with the adjustment to the decades-old family-planning policy (now all couples will be allowed to have two children), the latest changes to the hukou system follow years of half-hearted tinkering. They will allow migrant workers to apply for special residency permits which provide some of the benefits of an urban hukou (a booklet proving household registration is pictured above). If an urban hukou is like an internal passport, the residency permit is like a green card.

Under the arrangements, migrants will be able to apply for a permit if they have lived in a city for six months, and can show either an employment contract or a tenancy agreement. The document will allow access to state health care where the migrants live, and permit their children to go to local state schools up to the age of 15. It will also make other bureaucratic things easier, like buying a car. Such reforms have already been tried in some cities. They will now be rolled out nationwide.
For those who meet the requirements, the changes will bring two main benefits. They should allow some of the 70m children who have been left behind to attend school in their native villages to join their migrant parents. And it will allow migrants to use urban services without losing the main benefit of their rural hukou: the right to farm a plot of land. According to a survey in 2010 by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, 90% of migrants did not want to change their registration status because they feared losing this right.
Collar-colour counts
As with the two-child policy, though, there is less here than meets the eye. Most migrants are casual labourers. They rarely have any labour or tenancy contracts. The success of the reforms will also partly depend on funding. The government recently decided to tie schools’ budgets to the number of their pupils. In theory this will cover extra demand. But the system is untested.
There are other catches. In cities of between 500,000 and 1m people, applicants for urban hukou will need to have contributed to the government’s social-insurance scheme for three years. In cities of 1m-5m, the minimum is five years. And the reforms do not really apply in the biggest cities. They set their own requirements.
There are similar problems with the 13m people who have no hukou at all, which means they cannot obtain the identity card needed for everything from travelling by train or plane to obtaining a passport. About 60% of such people are “black” children, as they are often called in China, born in contravention of the one-child policy. On December 9th President Xi Jinping said those without hukou could obtain one. But it is unclear what kind of hukouthey will get and whether a fine will still have to be paid for violating the family-planning rules.
The government says it hopes 100m rural migrants (there are now about 250m of them living in urban areas) will have urban hukou by 2020. That seems unlikely. Many live in the biggest cities where, to judge by the reforms proposed by the city government of Beijing, changing status will get harder: the capital’s requirements give precedence to people who have paid 100,000 yuan ($15,500) in tax a year, far more than manual labourers earn.

The hukou policy was introduced in the 1950s to prevent a rush of migrants that might destabilise cities. Since the 1990s, China has depended on migration to provide cheap labour for its manufacturing boom. But it still wants to control where labourers move. It worries that an unregulated flow, especially into the biggest cities, may fuel discontent among the urban middle classes who fear that public services will be swamped. The new reforms to the hukou system appear mainly designed to push migrants away from big coastal cities towards smaller ones inland. Zuo Xiuli, a house-cleaner who has worked in Beijing for ten years and earns 2,500 yuan a month, is not sure he will bother to apply. “Of course I hope to get a Beijing hukou,” he says. “But it’s impossible for me.”
