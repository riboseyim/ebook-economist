#沙特的改革蓝图

>沙漠王国致力于成为地区领袖，同时完成经济现代化

The desert kingdom is striving to dominate its region and modernise its economy at the same time

**Jan 9th 2016**


多年以来，沙特似乎是懒惰无能的，仰仗其丰富的石油财富和美国赞助人的身份，对内维稳、对邻国施加影响力。
但是石油价格已经暴跌，美国已经从中东事务中退居幕后，这一区域是国际角力的热点，现在权力已经转移到新的一代人—尤其是塞勒曼国王宠爱的侄子（年轻30岁）—穆罕默德－本－塞勒曼（注：问题1）。一场变革风暴唤醒了这个沙漠王国。

可预见的结果是对国内反对派的残酷镇压和在国际事务中保持强硬。
1月2日，沙特处决了47人。
 他们中的大部分被指与基地组织有联系，但是另一些人，包括一名著名的什叶派领袖，只是因为曾今呼吁削弱沙特王室的统治。
在发生伊朗人大规模抗议、袭击沙特驻德黑兰使馆事件后，沙特断绝了与伊朗的外交关系，国际贸易和空中航线，一场严重而愚蠢的冲突在热点地区进一步升级。

抛开这个头条新闻，然而，与之对应的是，沙特的另一些行动将提升国家自信。
穆罕默德王储已经制定了一幅蓝图，旨在开放沙特封闭的经济和政府——他介绍说，也许包括出售国有石油公司Aramco的股票。

在动荡的地缘政治格局中，大规模的经济改革是一场赌博。
其结果将决定沙特王室的生死存亡，影响未来的阿拉伯世界。

阿拉伯式的撒切尔主义?

国际原油价格从2014年的110美元／桶一跃跌落到现在不足35美元，某种程度上是因为沙特希望维持其国际原油市场的份额。
尽管如此，持续走低的价格是一个定时炸弹，特别是对一个高度依赖石油的国家、财政收入90%以上依赖石油的政府而言。

政府预算赤字占GDP的比例已经在去年飙升至惊人的15%。 
尽管该国还有6500亿美元外汇储备，这个数字已经下降了1000亿美元。

当原油价格在1990年代下跌的时候，沙特只能大举借债。
他们获救于2000年代，中国的繁荣促使商品价格再次飙升。
这一次，包括沙特的统治阶层，没有人期望原油价格能回到3位数。
相反，他们也承认，经济必须改革。
本周，穆罕默德王储向《经济学人》介绍说，他已经制定了一幅改革蓝图，包含针对国家的一系列重大改革。

第一步是巩固财政。
目标是在接下来的5年中，持续削减财政赤字，即使石油价格依然在低位。
尽管可以削减很多赘肉，这依然是一件危险的事——这意味着拆解那些跟石油财富有关的系统，不仅事税收，还包括支付免费教育、医疗保障，以及高度补贴的电力、水和房屋供应。比钱更要命的是：慷慨的财政补贴在多大程度上掩盖了问题：长期非生产性经济、依赖外国劳动力。
对沙特人来着这一度非常容易：逃避工作，或者在政府办公室睡觉。

新的领导层已经开始采取行动。
在2015年过去的几个月内，削减政府开支，成功阻止 赤字占GDP 的比重飙升到20％。
2016年度的财政预算包括大幅提高汽油、电力和水价（尽管它们依然得到大量政府补贴）。
王储承诺在5年时间内转换成市场价格机制。他还致力于推出新税种，包括5%增值税，征收含糖饮料和烟草税，和土地空置税。

重新调整税收和补贴仅仅是第一步。
大约70%的沙特人不到30岁。与此同时，2/3的沙特人受雇于政府。劳动力预测显示2030年适龄人口数将翻倍，国家将繁荣兴盛，
只是需要首先改变沉睡的中央集权经济体制，在石油之外发展多样性，促进私营企业发展，引入市场驱动机制。


沙特政府计划采取措施使国家摆脱下列所有的基本职能。
从健康保障、教育到国营企业，新一代沙特领导层正在寻求私有化和私人供应的公共服务。
它们计划以特许学校和保险为基础，建设一个私营的健康保障系统。它们寻求全部或者部分地私有化超过24家机构和国营企业，包括国家航空公司，电信企业和供电企业。其中最大的标的是Aramco，一个国家的标志，几乎可以肯定的说是世界上最有价值的企业。王储赞成拿出一部分Aramco股票，在国际上开放出售。
他敦促自己的团队在几个月内拿出一个方案。

这个宏伟蓝图能变成现实吗？
说起来容易做起来难。沙特已经在改革之前做出过承诺，只不过它的成效让努力变得无足轻重。
它的资本市场非常薄弱，它的施政能力更加薄弱。
它需要投资于年轻人、非石油产业、旅游基础设施和其他的领域，这些投资都不便宜。
除非投资者相信这个国家的未来否则不可能实现。
这种信心的建立非常困难。


最好的计划

原因之一是类似希腊一样严厉的紧缩计划是非常困难且不受欢迎的。
（叙利亚和利比亚就是一个极端的例子）。国家通过某种程序上慷慨的经济补贴来弥补政治权利的缺失。
目前来看，王室家族不愿意释放政治高压以换取民众对紧缩政策的支持。
相较于经济领域的紧迫性，新政府看起来对政治改革没什么兴趣。
最近一次选举中，妇女被允许享有选举权和被选举权（很大程度上是无力的）市政议会是已故国王提出的主意。
也不是沙特宗教专制主义—伊斯兰国家与它的敌人缓和关系的标志。
最近一段时期内，处决人数创20年来新高。
穆罕默德王储向年轻一代承诺了很多好处。但是它也采纳了保守神职人员的一些建议，例如，禁止女人开车。

另外一个障碍是地缘政治。
伊朗已经变得更加自信，沙特已经陷入一个争夺逊尼派领袖的恶斗中。
他们必须面对那些获得伊朗支持的盟友，例如也门的侯赛因、叙利亚的巴沙尔- 阿萨德，以及国内的什叶派反对派和逊尼派统治的邻国巴林。

新的领导层主张基于维护稳定的需要，必须对恐怖分子发出明确信号（因此会有那些处决）。
为了捍卫自己的利益而遏制伊朗被认为是有必要的，伊朗声称，坚定致力于重建一个波斯帝国。
这场争论本身就是错误的：在穆斯林教派争斗中，沙特选择站在任何一方都不会赢，也是它无法承受的。
也门的战争是一个泥潭：支持埃及或其他逊尼派盟友都将是一大负担。
国防和安全支出已经超过全部政府支持的25%以上，并且随着预算紧缩政策它的比重还会攀升。
地区紧张局势也会阻碍私人投资。谁会把亿万投资放在一个动荡地区的孤立经济体中呢？


新政权看起来是把对国内外的强硬当作一个强大的沙特王国的标志。
目前为止，尽管强硬的外交政策在沙特人中颇受好评，如果王室家族最终激化了地区局势、阻碍国内的社会改革，经济就不会繁荣。
如果穆罕默德王储是为了重建他的国家，而不是毁坏它，他应该要懂得这些道理。

The Saudi blueprint
The desert kingdom is striving to dominate its region and modernise its economy at the same time
Jan 9th 2016  | From the print edition


FOR years Saudi Arabia seemed inert, relying on its vast oil wealth and the might of its American patron to buy quiet at home and impose stasis on its neighbours. But oil prices have tumbled, America has stood back from leadership in the Middle East, the region is on fire and power has shifted to a new generation—notably King Salman’s 30-year-old favoured son, Muhammad bin Salman. A sandstorm of change is rousing the desert kingdom.
The visible result is the brutal treatment of dissent at home and assertiveness abroad that has just been on chilling display. On January 2nd Saudi Arabia executed 47 people. Most of them were terrorists linked to al-Qaeda but some, including a prominent Shia cleric, simply called for the fall of the ruling House of Saud. After Iranians set fire to the Saudi embassy in Tehran in protest, the kingdom cut diplomatic, trade and air links, a grave and foolish escalation in a febrile region.
Away from the headlines, however, a different assertiveness could prove equally consequential. Prince Muhammad has drawn up a blueprint designed to throw open Saudi Arabia’s closed economy and government—including, he says, the possible sale of shares in the national oil firm, Saudi Aramco.
Coupling geopolitical swagger with sweeping economic change is a gamble. The outcome will determine the survival of the House of Saud and shape the future of the Arab world.
What is Arabic for Thatcherism?
The plunge in the price of oil, from $110 a barrel in 2014 to less than $35 today, was partly because Saudi Arabia seems determined to protect its share of the oil market. Nevertheless, low prices are a time-bomb for a country dominated by oil and a government that relies on it for up to 90% of its revenues. The budget deficit swelled last year to a staggering 15% of GDP. Although the country has $650 billion of foreign reserves, they have already fallen by $100 billion.
When oil prices fell in the 1990s, the Saudis simply borrowed heavily. They were saved when China’s boom sent commodity prices soaring again in the 2000s. This time no one, including the Saudi rulers, expects a return to triple-digit oil prices. Instead, they acknowledge that the economy must change. Speaking to The Economist this week (see Briefing), Prince Muhammad laid out a blueprint for reform that amounts to a radical redesign of the Saudi state.
The first step is fiscal consolidation. The goal is to eliminate the budget deficit in the next five years, even if the oil price stays low. Though there is much flab to cut, that is still a perilous undertaking which means dismantling the system according to which petro-cash, not taxes, pay for free education and health care as well as highly subsidised electricity, water and housing. More than money is at stake: this largesse has disguised how far the economy is chronically unproductive and dependent on foreign labour. It has been too easy for Saudis to avoid working, or to snooze away in government offices.
The new leadership has made a start. Spending cuts in the last months of 2015 stopped the deficit from soaring to more than 20% of GDP. The 2016 budget includes steep rises in the prices of petrol, electricity and water (though they remain heavily subsidised). The prince pledges to move to market prices by the end of the five-year period. He is also committed to new taxes, including a value-added tax of 5%, sin taxes on sugary drinks and cigarettes, and levies on vacant land.  
Recalibrating taxes and subsidies is only the first step. Roughly 70% of Saudis are under 30. At the same time, two-thirds of Saudi workers are employed by the government. With the workforce projected to double by 2030, the country will prosper only if the sleepy statist economy is turned on its head, diversifying from oil, boosting private business and introducing market-driven efficiencies.
The government plans to do this by getting the state out of all but its essential functions. From health and education to state-owned companies, the new Saudi leadership is looking for privatisation and the private provision of public services. It has plans for charter schools and an insurance-based, privately provided health-care system. It is looking at the complete or partial privatisation of more than two dozen agencies and state-owned companies, including the national airline, telecoms firm and power generator. The biggest fish of all is Aramco, a national icon and almost certainly the world’s most valuable firm. The prince favours floating a minority stake in Aramco and opening its books to the world. He is urging his team to come up with a plan within months (see article).
Could such a blueprint become reality? Words are cheap and the obstacles huge. Saudi Arabia has promised reform before, only for its efforts to fizzle into insignificance. Its capital markets are thin and the capacity of its bureaucracy thinner. The investment that it needs in its young people, its non-oil industries, its tourism infrastructure and much else will not come cheap. It will not happen unless investors believe in the country’s future. That confidence will be hard to build.
The best-laid plans
One reason is that austerity on an almost Greek scale will be difficult and unpopular (though the examples of Syria and Libya are a deterrent against outright rebellion—see page 41). The state has provided generously partly to make up for the lack of political rights. Yet the royal family is reluctant to open the pressure valves that might make cuts more palatable. For all its economic urgency, the new regime shows no interest in political reform. Recent elections in which women were allowed to vote and to stand for (largely powerless) municipal councils were the idea of the late king. Nor is there a sign that the religious absolutism Saudi Arabia shares with its enemy, Islamic State, will soften. Even before the latest round, executions were at a 20-year high. Prince Muhammad waxes lyrical about the new generation. But he has little appetite to take on the conservative clergy over, say, the ban on women driving.

The other obstacle is geopolitics. As Iran has become more assertive, the Saudis have stepped in as the champion of Sunni Muslims. They have confronted Iranian-supported allies such as the Houthis in Yemen and Bashar al-Assad in Syria, as well as Shia malcontents at home and in neighbouring Sunni-ruled countries like Bahrain.
The new leadership argues that stability requires it to send a signal to terrorists (hence the executions). It feels obliged to defend its interests by resisting Iran which, it says, is bent on recreating a Persian empire. The argument is flawed: Saudi Arabia instead risks leading one side in a Muslim sectarian struggle it can neither win nor afford. The war in Yemen is a morass; support for Egypt and other Sunni allies is a drain. Defence and security already take over 25% of government spending and will eat up a growing share of a shrinking budget. Regional tensions will also deter private investment. Who would put trillions into an isolated economy in a region in turmoil?
The new regime seems to regard boldness at home and abroad as signs of a strong Saudi Arabia. Yet, though a muscular foreign policy plays well among Saudis, the economy will not thrive if the royal family ends up inflaming its region and blocking social reform at home. If Prince Muhammad is to remake his country, not wreck it, he needs to understand that.

Correction: the original version of this article stated that the country had 29m-plus Saudis. This has been corrected.
