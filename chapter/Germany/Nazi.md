# 德国纳粹魅影

**阿道夫·希特勒死后70年，他在德国人心中的形象已经发生变化**

2015-12-19 ｜柏林

       在德国，与欧洲大陆其他国家一样，版权保护机制会在作者去世70年之后自动失效。
即使作者是阿道夫·希特勒，以及他的作品《我的奋斗》。从1945年开始，巴伐利亚州拥有该书德语版权，它曾拒绝该书再次出版。
德国图书馆保存有该书的早期底本，并且可以自由买卖。但是从1月1日开始，重新印刷这本书将不再需要任何许可。

     德国之外的人们似乎很难立刻感觉到这一标志性时刻的重要意义。《我的奋斗》早已有各种语言的译本，在互联网上更是随处可得。
但这不是重点。对德国人来说，该书版权保护过期事件以及引起了社会巨大的不安和激烈的争论。现在的问题是，当德国人在欢庆新年的时候，
并不意味着要如何面对《我的奋斗》进入公共视野。更重要的是，当代德国如何看待希特勒。

     《我的奋斗》是一本杂糅了自传和竞选纲领的小册子，1923年希特勒政变失败之后，他开始在相当舒适的监狱中写作。它开始出版了两卷，在1925年和1926年。书名的意思是“我是屌丝，我要逆袭”（呵呵），希特勒充分使用了坚决、不容置疑的语气、文法、风格。一位同时代的评论家嘲笑该书是“我是神经病”。 这本书的大部分内容对现代人来说是乏味、愚蠢、无法理解的。还有一部分内容则夹杂了当时的一些流行语（鸡汤么？）：“哥伦布的鸡蛋是千万双手托举起来的，但是像哥伦布一样的人却是世间少有的”。

     当时在德国引起巨大反响的社会达尔文主义和反犹太主义被毫不掩饰地编织进这本小册子，你完全可以感受到作者杀气腾腾的暴力暗示。对于德国曾经在第一次世界大战中受到英国的毒气攻击，希特勒写到：如果把那些使希伯来民族腐败堕落的人投进毒气中，对数百万德国各领域的优秀工人来说，眼前的百万献祭无疑具有伟大意义。
     
     目前不清楚究竟有多少德国人读过这部巨著。但是1993年希特勒掌权之后，它变成了畅销书。
从1936年开始，一些市政当局将这本书发给宣誓之后的新婚夫妇，到第二次世界大战结束的时候还有1300万册在印刷。
    
     二战结束之后，轮到美国人决定这本书的命运，希特勒的最后一处私人地址在慕尼黑属于美国占领区。德意志第三帝国已经消失，联邦德国则需要等到1949年才回成立。因此美国人将版权转给巴伐利亚政府。巴伐利亚政府则明令禁止继续出版该书。

     一些现象可以揭示在战后第一阶段德国面对希特勒遗产的复杂心态。战后当局的态度是镇压任何可能引诱德国人回归纳粹的言论。
盟军和德国新政府的政策是“去纳粹化”，将那些前纳粹分子从重要岗位上解雇。但是随着冷战的大幕拉开，西德作为盟友的地位日渐提高。
因为缺乏专业人士，德国重要单位、政府部门、司法系统和教育系统又重新雇佣了前纳粹成员。

     1940年代末至1950年代，德国人尽量避免讨论关于希特勒的一切。许多男人从监狱中释放出来。许多妇女曾经被强奸。人们曾经居背井离乡，变成孤儿和寡妇。德国人曾经同时兼具犯罪者和受害者的身份，很难用一个词描述他们的精神状态。许多人饱受精神创伤，谈论过去经历的痛苦更是无法忍受。
他们觉得活在当下、为了经济奇迹而忙碌可以让自己心里感觉好些。许多人依然否认广泛存在的大屠杀。根据Thomas Sandkühler的材料（近期出版的《阿道夫－希特勒传》作者），一份1950年代的民意调查显示几乎半数的西德民众认为希特勒称得上是“德国最伟大的政治家之一”，如果他没有发动世界大战的话。
    
1960年代事态进入了新阶段，随着纳粹指挥官Adolf Eichmann被以色列人抓捕、审讯和执行死刑。大屠杀的细节被公之于众。
1963年开始，22名前党卫军成员在法兰克福被起诉，因他们在奥斯维辛集中营的罪行。德国人被这些案件深深吸引：20000人在开庭期间赶赴法兰克福法庭。从这时开始 Vergangenheitsbewältigung （应付过去；反身）开始出现在德国人的餐桌，然而却引起家庭分裂。


－－－－－图
     儿女们指责他们的父母和教授串通勾结犯下罪行，于是在家庭和校园表达抗议和嫌恶。他们的长辈则撤退到厨房，以及他们在过去大屠杀期间的生活和作为。
一对精神分析学家夫妇，亚历山大 和玛格丽特－奥斯古特，在1967年出版著作中称这种病理症状为“无奈的悲伤”。他们认为德国人因此长期无法摆脱宗教和心理上困扰。

     德国官方的应对政策有两种。
东德政府宣传这些恐怖传说，同时强调他们英勇的共产主义者过去一直在与法西斯战斗。事实上，他们对过去没有什么认同。
西德政府则承认过去的罪行，同时由政府出资开展赔偿工作。德国实际上已经变成了和平主义社会，常被称为“后英雄主义”，以区别于盟友们的战争文化。德国同样变成了 “后国家主义”：西德人在体育赛事中很少升国旗、唱国歌。年轻一代在寻找身份认同时，要么选择次国家主义（如斯瓦比亚人或巴伐利亚人），要么选择超国家主义，如欧洲人。
    
     1970年代一股被压抑的希特勒热潮重新出现。两部传记和一部纪录片出版，1979年德国播出《大屠杀》（一部美国制作的的系列电视纪录片），刺激德国人开始了新一轮的灵魂研究。许多人因此改变了他们的观点，里夏德·冯·魏茨泽克，时任联邦德国总统，在1985年德国战败40周年纪念日上发表了历史性演讲。1945年5月8日不是德国失败、垮塌的日子，而是德国的解放纪念日。


     1990年德国重新统一之后，正式宣告战后时代结束——德国公众对历史问题的饥渴需求催生了大量研究成果。
《明镜》周刊，在1990年代有16次是把希特勒的头像作为封面。美国历史学家Daniel Jonah Goldhagen出版著作，他主张普通德国人就是“希特勒愿景的帮凶”，形成巨大影响。一个博物馆举办了国防军展览（德国战时武装），揭示了普通德国士兵（还不仅仅是党卫军）也参与了大屠杀。大批德国人排长队去参观。
     与此同时还有一种被德国人称为“希特勒色情片” 和 “庸俗希特勒艺术” 的流行风潮存在。元首变成了一种市场营销工具。
它开始与1980年代的《史登》杂志，刊登了据称是希特勒的日记，引起一场轰动，后来被证实是伪造的。1990年代德国电视台历史频道几乎每晚播出记录片：关于希特勒的女人、亲信、最后的日子、疾病、银质的桌子或者德国牧羊犬（被叫做“布隆迪”）。这位矮个、小胡子男人刷牙的画面被呈现在观众眼前。以这种方式，希特勒变得越来越色情和暴力：借此促进版权销量或者吸引眼球。


     但是这些流行风潮进一步拉开了历史真相的距离。大多数观众而言，他们现在已经对希特勒没有个人印象。
这解释了另外一种艺术题材的情况：讽刺剧。在他有生之年，谁模仿希特勒谁就是德国的敌人，1940年喜剧大师卓别林的电影《大独裁者》上映。
1998年Walter Moers通过连载漫画的形式成为第一个模仿希特勒的德国人，“阿道夫，该死的纳粹猪”。它的制片人宣称这个人物是“我们创造的最伟大的时尚明星”。

     最近一个畅销商品是Timur Vermes出品的“看看谁回来了”，今年被翻译成英语。希特勒突然苏醒在现在柏林，他过去的古堡附近。一开始他找不到方向，接着逗笑了每一位见到的人，包括他的土耳其干洗工人，这在喜剧演员中一度成为流行职业。他的同事试图证明他是一个完美的“messed ekta” (柏林英语中对演技派演员的称呼），对现代传媒文化进行了一些批判。

       对德国年轻一代来说，元首仿佛在过去的时光中渐行渐远，看起来稀奇古怪而不在诱惑撩人。在“看看谁回来了”节目中，他那些不断重复的无聊习语来自《我的奋斗》，例如“山雀追寻山雀，芬奇追寻芬奇，鹳鸟追寻鹳鸟，田鼠追寻田鼠。。。” 但是这些词汇和声音，伴随着他那有名的“R”卷舌，不在让人狂欢。

战后跟希特勒有关的禁忌一个接一个都消失了。
挥舞旗帜就是其中一个。突破出现在2006年，当德国举办足球世界杯的时候。自从二战以来，黑－红－金黄旗帜第一次出现在所有地方，悬挂在阳台、婴儿车、汽车和比基尼泳装。
来访国家的旗帜也是如此，德国变身一个盛大的街头狂欢节。主办方和来访者都没感觉有什么异样，而且觉得很有趣。

在今年YouGov公司的一份民意调查中，德国人被询问他们会把那个人或事与德国联系在一起。
他们提供的选项中大众牌汽车排第一（尴尬，给随后的结论作弊）。
接下来是歌德和默克尔总理，接下来是颂歌，国家足球队和勃朗特总理。希特勒以25%的得票率排名第七。
在同样的调查中，70%的德国人说他们为自己的国家感到自豪。许多人认为德国是民主和包容的典范，现在是停止感到内疚和羞愧的时候了。

Forever abnormal 永远不正常

     目前仍有75%的人认为希特勒的罪行决定德国还不能成为一个“正常”国家，同时必须扮演一个“特殊国际义务的角色”。
这意味着许多德国人将以某种方式将骄傲和赎罪结合起来。德国当代文化试图解决这一内在冲突的情形，即使很多时候表面上看起来与希特勒无关。

先拿德国的政党辩论来说。
与法国人、英国人和美国人有显著差异的是，德国人对政府的监控行为非常担忧，无论是针对外国人还是德国人。
焦虑的根源来自希特勒时代盖世太保的记忆（以及最近的东德斯塔西－国家安全部）。
关于德国人对以色列人负有特殊责任这一观点也具有广泛共识。和平主义得到所有主流政党的贯彻。


事实上，德国强大的综合国力常常使自己陷入窘境。
在国内外它支持通过协商主张权利。基于这个规则，它几乎到了痴迷的程度，即使盟友们已经气得跺脚（例如欧债危机）。
同样基于这个规则，它也不愿像“霸主”一样采取行动，正如它的盟友们常常希望的那样。
当被问到默克尔女士是否是“欧盟最具权威的领袖”，她的发言人气愤地回答道：“那不是我们希望扮演的角色”。

在政治风格上也是，德国看起来总是想不断证明自己已经远离希特勒。
2008年，巴拉克－奥巴马作为总统候选人访问柏林，德国人蜂拥而至聆听他激情洋溢的演讲。但是他们绝不接受这种雄辩滔滔的风格出现在自己的政治家身上，这容易让人联想起希特勒蛊惑人心的特殊魅力。在默克尔女士的引领下，“整个德国政治家阶层使用一种平淡的乐高语言，空洞习语组织拼凑而成”， Timothy Garton Ash，一位牛津大学中的亲德派英国人。“基于希特勒的因素，德国当代政治修辞的调色板非常谨慎、小心翼翼且乏味”。

     国内政治准则已经被1949年正式通过战后宪法确认，这部宪法直接驳斥了希特勒的世界观，已经成为当代爱国精神的来源。
宪法第一款规定“人的尊严神圣不容侵犯”。这项规定落实到司法实践中之后，就算在美国也可称得上露骨，监狱类似于经济型酒店，另外还有全欧洲最欢迎寻求庇护者／难民的系列政策，尽管在当前的难民危机的实施过程中已经有所调整。

     但是因为希特勒的缘故，德国人“不再敢绘制宏伟蓝图”，Stephan Grünewald说到，一位德国心理学家和《德国心理治疗》一书的作者。
他们拒绝为了伟大的目标而兴奋，以避免因为某种迷恋而再次被奴役。他们愿意展开大变革—例如将国家的能源逐步过渡到可再生能源—除非是在没有道德争议的情况下。Grünewald先生说，他们中的一部分仍然希望获得“世界破坏者过渡到世界救世主的历史地位”。

     这些情况并不意味着希特勒造成了当代德国人的乏味。德国官方仍然在向世界展示德国人的美德，例如守时和可靠。
但是在这些“保护盾”背后，Rheingold Salon的心理学家们说到，一家位于科隆的市场研究公司，许多德国人喜欢高端、奇特的生活方式，从娱乐到性等所有的事情上。在刻板印象的背后，德国人往往是秘密的怪人。
The hidden Schmerz and Angst 隐秘的痛苦和焦虑

     在一个更加隐秘的领域，希特勒依然在折磨着德国的老年人和中年人：他们的内心。
1928～1947年出生的一代人，被称为Kriegskinder （战争儿童）。1955～1970年出生的人，包括他们的孩子，被称为Kriegsenkel（战争孙子女）。
这些术语来自Helmut Redebold，一位现年80岁高龄的精神治疗师。作为战争儿童，他在大轰炸中从柏林撤退，然后经历“俄罗斯人的占领”。
一个晚上她的母亲在干草垛上挖了一个洞，蜷缩在里面，让小赫尔穆特躺在她上面，为了避免被发现，她母亲被强奸了。
    
     1980年代Radebold先生治疗了他这一代人的很多心理疾病。渐渐的，他发现这些疾病与战争相关，因为这些战争儿童“从不被允许悲伤”。
“我自己变得压抑、沮丧，并且常常哭泣，”Radebold先生回忆说。“我亲身经历的历史催促我做点什么”。他开始写关于这一特殊现象的书籍。

     很多德国老年人今天看似奇怪的行为都源于那些被压抑的记忆，他说到。为什么这些人在富裕生活的情况下仍要东掖西藏食物？他们为什么会害怕烟火或警报？
为什么一些住养老院的妇女会忍不住嚎啕大哭，当遇到男性护理人员晚上过来给她们换尿布的时候？战争儿童小时候的精神创伤被唤醒了，他说到。


    他们的孩子，战争孙子女一代，有不一样的问题。当他们长大的时候，他们父母的情绪常常是冷漠压抑的。
家长们从战争状态中走出来，归于平静或者说是麻木，或者他们从没有完全走出来，Sabine Bode说到，这个主题的另一位作家。
这损害了他们与孩子的正常关系，凭直觉知道的事永远不必多说，或者什么话似乎被删去了，取而代之一句叹息，孩子继承了他们父母的创伤。
后来，作为成年人，他们问道—正如Radebold先生的女儿做的一样—问题：为什么你对我们的问题毫不关心？为什么我们会梦到你被轰炸？

     最近几年战争孙子女们成立了互助组织。只有40%的中年德国人愿意分享类似“跨代”伤害，Radebold先生说。
但是大部分刻板德国人的焦虑和对秩序、稳定的渴望来源于此。Bode女士认为当代许多战争孙子女具有“较低的生命能量”。

     随着《我的奋斗》失去版权保护，德国社会显得比以往更复杂。
五分之一的当代德国人有移民血统，这样的家庭也和希特勒的时代没有联系。许多年轻人对历史知之甚少，知道希特勒与外星人、令人着迷等小八卦。
一些人—大部分过去是东德的—在新纳粹摇滚音乐会大喊口号，因为他们对希特勒冲击统治权威的能力非常痴迷。其他德国人则抱着非常复杂的心态。
他们尽量对外保持友善—例如，帮助移民。然而，他们仍然害怕他们自己和他们的同胞。

     所以即使不是非常偏激，德国依然保持警惕。大部分联邦州禁止向特定社团颁发执照（例如HH 88，意为“希特勒万岁”）。
目前仍在致力于禁止一个新纳粹党取名为NPD（德国国家民主党），尽管该党2014年已经获得欧洲议会超过1%的席位。

     将《我的奋斗》释放进入公共领域是不容易的。2012年巴伐利亚召集犹太人和罗姆人代表在纽伦堡举办了研讨会。
他们同意巴伐利亚资助浅显的著作，用以在出版市场驱逐新右翼的出版物。州议会一致批准了这个计划。一个研究机构被指定从事后续工作。
但是后来巴伐利亚总理（Horst Seehofer）访问以色列，一些受害者组织反对这项计划。

     面对这些互相矛盾的态度，巴伐利亚官方受到惊吓。2013年州政府退出了学术出版行动，目前该行动没有获得官方资助。
与此同时，16个联邦州司法部长表示，他们将继续以“煽动人民”的罪名，起诉那些摆卖《我的奋斗》的人。
 

     如果一个国家曾经可以说是好的，德国今天可以。但是德国人知道，当他们与别人一起发怒的时候，他们会在总理海报上描绘一个希特勒式的胡子。
许多德国人已经受够了这些—被“感情胁迫”，Bild ,主要的通俗小报，在这个春天发起抗议，当希腊在解决欧债危机谈判中意外地提出战争赔款问题。
其他德国人，主要是左翼，为新一轮“后民族主义”感到担忧，像是德国谨慎的表达自己对海外利益的关切。对大部分国家来说，这很正常。但是对德国而言，它依然是很复杂的。

Hitler
What the Führer means for Germans today
Seventy years after Adolf Hitler’s death, how Germans see him is changing
Dec 19th 2015  | BERLIN | From the print edition




IN GERMANY, as in the rest of Europe, copyright expires seven decades after the author’s year of death.
That applies even when the author is Adolf Hitler and the work is “Mein Kampf”. Since 1945, the state of Bavaria has owned the book’s German-language rights and has refused to allow its republication. German libraries stock old copies, and they can be bought and sold. But from January 1st no permission will be needed to reprint it.

Those living outside Germany may not immediately grasp the significance of the moment. “Mein Kampf” has always been available in translation and is now just a click away online. But that is not the point. For Germans, the expiry of the copyright has caused hand-wringing and controversy. The question, as they ring in the new year, is not what to do about “Mein Kampf” as it enters the public domain. Rather, it is what Hitler means for Germany today.

“Mein Kampf” is a mix of autobiography and manifesto that Hitler began writing during a rather comfortable prison stay after his failed putsch of 1923. It was first published in two volumes in 1925 and 1926. The title means “My Struggle”, and Hitler certainly struggled with syntax, grammar and style. One contemporary reviewer ridiculed it as “Mein Krampf” (My Cramp). Much of it is dull or incomprehensible today. Some phrases demand parody: “Columbus’s eggs lie around by the hundreds of thousands, but Columbuses are met with less frequently.”
Woven into the prose are crude Social Darwinism and anti-Semitism that resonated even beyond Germany, as well as hints of the author’s murderous potential. Having been gassed by the British in the first world war, Hitler writes: if some of the “Hebrew corrupters of the people had been held under poison gas, as happened to hundreds of thousands of our very best German workers in the field, the sacrifice of millions at the front would not have been in vain.”

It is not clear how many Germans read the tome. But after 1933, when Hitler seized power, it became a bestseller. From 1936 some municipalities gave it to newlyweds after their vows, and by the end of the second world war about 13m copies were in print.


After the war it fell to the Americans to decide what to do about the book, because Hitler’s last private address, in Munich, was in their sector. The Third Reich was gone and the Federal Republic of Germany would not be born until 1949. So the Americans transferred the rights to the government of Bavaria. It banned printing of the book.
This approach reflected the first post-war phase in the German treatment of Hitler’s legacy. The idea was to suppress anything that might tempt the Germans to fall back under his spell. The Allies and the new German government followed a policy of “de-nazification”, under which known Nazis were banned from important positions. But as the cold war unfolded, West Germany was needed as an ally. For lack of alternatives, ministries, courtrooms and schools employed former Nazis again.
In the late 1940s and 1950s Germans avoided discussing Hitler. Many men were returning from captivity. Many women had been raped. People had been displaced, orphaned or widowed. Germans had been both perpetrators and victims, and had no words for their state of mind. Many were traumatised and could not bear to talk about their experiences. They found it psychologically easier to dwell in the present and keep busy with the Wirtschaftswunder, the post-war “economic miracle”. Many still denied the full scale of the Holocaust. According to Thomas Sandkühler, author of “Adolf H.”, a recent biography, a poll in the 1950s found that almost half of West Germans thought Hitler would have been “one of the greatest German statesmen” if he had not started the war.

Germans were glued to Eichmann’s trial. The details of the Holocaust it revealed split families
A new phase began in the 1960s, after the Israelis captured, tried and executed Adolf Eichmann, a leading Nazi. This made more details of the Holocaust public. Starting in 1963, 22 former SS men were prosecuted in Frankfurt for their crimes in Auschwitz. The Germans were glued to these cases: 20,000 people went to the Frankfurt courtroom during the sessions. For the first time Vergangenheitsbewältigung (“coping with the past”) came to kitchen tables, where it split families.
Sons and daughters accused their parents and professors of complicity and rebelled at home and on campus. Their elders retreated into sanitised tales of what they had done or lived through. A husband-and-wife team of psychoanalysts, Alexander and Margarete Mitscherlich, called this pathology “the inability to grieve” in a book of that title published in 1967. This mired the Germans in an ongoing moral and psychological crisis, they thought.

Official Germany found two responses. East Germany adopted the fiction that its righteous communists had resisted the “fascists” all along. In effect, it never reckoned with the past. But West Germany accepted its guilt and atoned publicly. It became a pacifist society, often called “post-heroic” in contrast to the Allies’ warrior cultures. It also became “post-national”: West Germans rarely flew their flag and barely whispered their anthem at sporting events. The young sought identity either sub-nationally (as Swabians or Bavarians, say) or supra-nationally, as good Europeans.

But starting in the 1970s a pent-up fascination with Hitler began to re-emerge. Two biographies and a documentary came out, and in 1979 Germany aired “Holocaust”, an American television series, which shocked Germans into a new round of soul-searching. Many changed their perceptions in a way that Richard von Weizsäcker, then West Germany’s president, expressed in a historic speech in 1985, on the 40th anniversary of Germany’s surrender. May 8th 1945 was not the date of Germany’s defeat and collapse, he said, but of its liberation.
After reunification in 1990—the formal end of the post-war era—the German public became ravenous for more research. Der Spiegel, a weekly news magazine, featured Hitler on its cover 16 times during the 1990s. A book by an American historian, Daniel Jonah Goldhagen, in which he argued that ordinary Germans were “Hitler’s Willing Executioners”, became a hit. A museum exhibition about the Wehrmacht, Germany’s wartime army, argued that ordinary soldiers (rather than just the SS) had participated in the Holocaust. Germans queued around the block to see it.
But there was a parallel trend towards what Germans call “Hitler porn” and “Hitler kitsch”. The Führer became a marketing tool. It started in the 1980s when Stern, a magazine, published what it alleged was Hitler’s diary, a sensation that turned out to be fake. Since the 1990s the history channel on German television has aired almost nightly documentaries on Hitler’s women, henchmen, last days, ailments, table silver or German Shepherd dog (called Blondi). Any footage of the small man with the toothbrush moustache draws an audience. In that way, Hitler has become like sex and violence: bait to sell copies or to grab attention.
But this fascination also suggests a new distance. Most of the audience, after all, now have no personal recollection of Hitler. This explains another genre: satire. During his lifetime, it was Germany’s enemies who parodied Hitler, as in Charlie Chaplin’s film of 1940, “The Great Dictator”. But in 1998 Walter Moers became the first German satirist to score a hit with a comic strip, “Adolf, die Nazi-Sau” (“Adolf, the Nazi pig”). Its producer called the character “the greatest pop star we’ve ever created”.
The latest bestseller is “Look Who’s Back” by Timur Vermes, translated into English this year. Hitler wakes up in today’s Berlin near his old bunker. Disoriented at first, he so amuses everybody he meets, including his Turkish dry-cleaner, that he is launched on a meteoric career as a comedian. His hip colleagues are convinced that he is a consummate “messed ekta” (Berlinish-English for method actor) offering a subtle critique of modern media culture.
For young Germans the Führer has thus receded far enough into the past to seem outlandish and weird rather than potentially seductive. In “Look Who’s Back”, he regurgitates inane phrases from “Mein Kampf”, such as: “The titmouse seeks the titmouse, the finch the finch, the stork the stork, the field mouse the field mouse…” But the words and the diction, with its famously rolled “r”, have no effect other than hilarity.
For the football World Cup in 2006 the black-red-and-gold came out everywhere
One by one, post-war taboos connected to Hitler are vanishing. Flag-waving is one. A breakthrough occurred in 2006, when Germany hosted the football World Cup. For the first time since the war the black-red-and-gold came out everywhere, draping balconies, prams, cars and bikinis. But so did the flags of the visiting countries, and Germany turned into one big street party. Hosts and visitors perceived it as nothing but fun.

In a poll by YouGov this year, Germans were asked what person or thing they associate with Germany. They named Volkswagen first (awkwardly, given subsequent revelations of its cheating). Then came Goethe and Angela Merkel, the chancellor, next the anthem, the national football team and Willy Brandt, a former chancellor. Hitler ranked a distant seventh at 25%. In the same poll 70% of Germans said they were proud of their country. About as many thought that Germany was a model of tolerance and democracy, and that it was time to stop feeling guilt and shame.
Forever abnormal
And yet 75% also said that Hitler’s crimes mean Germany still cannot be a “normal” country and must play a “special international role”. This means that many Germans somehow combine both pride and penance. Attempts to resolve this inner conflict shape much of German culture today, even when the subject ostensibly has nothing to do with Hitler.
Start with Germany’s political discourse. In contrast to the French, British and Americans, Germans worry a lot about surveillance by governments, whether foreign or German. The anxiety stems from memories of Hitler’s Gestapo (and more recently the East German Stasi). There is also a wide consensus that Germany has a special responsibility towards Israel. Pacifism runs through all mainstream political parties.
Indeed Germany is discomfited by power generally, especially its own. At home and abroad it advocates right over might. Hence its apparent obsession with rules, even to the exasperation of its partners (in the euro crisis, for example). Hence also its reluctance to act like a “hegemon”, as its allies often demand. Asked whether Mrs Merkel is “the most powerful leader in the European Union”, her spokesman replies indignantly: “Those are not the categories in which we think.”
In political style, too, Germany seems to want constantly to prove that it has moved on from Hitler. Germans flocked to Barack Obama when he visited Berlin as a candidate in 2008 in part for his soaring oratory. But they would never accept such rhetoric in their own politicians, for it would remind them of Hitler’s demagogic charisma. Led by Mrs Merkel, “the entire German political class uses a kind of sanitised Lego language, snapping together prefabricated phrases made of hollow plastic”, says Timothy Garton Ash, a British Germanophile at Oxford University. “Because of Hitler, the palette of contemporary German political rhetoric is deliberately narrow, cautious and boring.”
Domestic life is governed by Germany’s post-war constitution, which was adopted in 1949 as a direct rejoinder to Hitler’s worldview and has become a source of patriotism today. Its first article stipulates that “human dignity shall be inviolable”. This translates into police practices that would count as touchy-feely in America, prisons that resemble low-budget hotels, and one of Europe’s most welcoming policies towards asylum-seekers, despite all the strain that this has imposed during the current refugee crisis.
But because of Hitler, the Germans “no longer dare to develop grand visions”, argues Stephan Grünewald, a German psychologist and author of “Germany on the Couch”. They resist getting excited about big ideas lest they succumb again to some obsession. Instead, Germans publicly don a “cool indifference” in an atmosphere of stultifying political correctness. They are willing to back big reforms—as in the country’s energy transition to renewables—only when there is no moral ambiguity. Part of them, says Mr Grünewald, still yearns to graduate from the “historical position of world destroyer to that of world saviour”.
This does not mean that Hitler made today’s Germans boring. Official Germany still displays virtues the world considers German, such as punctuality and reliability. But behind this “protective shield”, say psychologists at Rheingold Salon, a market-research firm in Cologne, many Germans adopt highly idiosyncratic lifestyles in everything from hobbies to sex. Contrary to stereotype, Germans are often secret eccentrics.
The hidden Schmerz and Angst
There is, however, an even more intimate domain in which Hitler continues to torment older and middle-aged Germans: their minds. One generation, defined roughly as those born between 1928 and 1947, is called the Kriegskinder (“war children”). The other, born between 1955 and 1970 or so, consists of their children and is called the Kriegsenkel(“war grandchildren”). These terms come from Helmut Radebold, a psychotherapist who is now 80 years old. As a war child he was evacuated from Berlin when it was bombed and then “overrun by the Russians”. At night his mother dug a hole in haystacks, curled up inside and made little Helmut lie on top of her to avoid being found and raped.
In the 1980s Mr Radebold was treating men of his generation for various psychological ailments. Gradually, he saw connections to the war, because these Kriegskinder had “never been allowed to grieve”. “I myself became depressed and often cried,” Mr Radebold recalls. “My own history caught up with me.” He began writing books about the phenomenon.
Much of what seems strange today about some older Germans has roots in these repressed memories, he says. Why do these people squirrel away food amid plenty? Why are they scared of fireworks or sirens? Why do some women in nursing homes wail uncontrollably when male carers come to change their nappies at night? As the Kriegskinder age, he says, old traumas resurface.
Their children, the Kriegsenkel, have different problems. As they grew up, their parents were often emotionally frozen. The elders came out of the war in a sedated or numb state from which they never fully emerged, says Sabine Bode, another writer on the topic. This impaired relations with their children, who, by intuiting what must never be said or what was omitted with a sigh, inherited their parents’s trauma. Later, as adults, they asked—as Mr Radebold’s daughter did—questions such as: Why were you never interested in our little problems? And why do we have nightmares about your firebombings?
In recent years support groups have formed for the grandchildren of the war. Only about 40% of middle-aged Germans share such “transgenerational” trauma, says Mr Radebold. But much of the stereotypical German angst and yearning for order and stability originates here. Mrs Bode thinks that many of the Kriegsenkel today have “lower life energy”.
As “Mein Kampf” loses its copyright, German society is more complex than ever. One in five Germans today has immigrant roots and thus no family link to Hitler’s time. Many of the young know little history and find Hitler alien and fascinating. A few—somewhat more in what used to be East Germany—shout Sieg heil at neo-Nazi rock concerts because they are drawn to Hitler’s ability to shock the establishment. Other Germans have complex cocktails of emotions. They are extra-keen to do good—by helping refugees, for example. Yet they remain afraid of themselves and their compatriots.
And so Germany remains vigilant, if not quite paranoid. Most federal states ban licence plates with certain combinations (such as HH 88, code for “Heil Hitler”). An effort is under way to ban a neo-Nazi party called NPD, even though it won a mere 1% in the European elections of 2014.
Releasing “Mein Kampf” into the public domain was thus never going to be easy. In 2012 Bavaria convened Jewish and Roma representatives in Nuremberg for a discussion. They agreed that Bavaria should fund a scholarly edition to drive new right-wing publications out of the market and demystify the book. The state parliament approved the plan unanimously. A research institute was selected and got to work. But later that year Bavaria’s premier, Horst Seehofer, visited Israel, where some victims’ groups opposed the plan.
Faced with these conflicting attitudes, Bavarian officialdom took fright. In 2013 the state pulled out of the scholarly effort, which now proceeds without official backing. Meanwhile, the justice ministers of the 16 federal states have said that they will continue to prosecute anybody hawking the book for “incitement of the people”.

If a country can ever be said to be good, Germany today can. And yet Germans know that whenever others are angry with them, they will paint a Hitler moustache on posters of their chancellor. Many Germans are fed up with this—with being “blackmailed”, as Bild, the leading tabloid, complained this spring, when Greece unexpectedly brought war reparations into negotiations about bail-outs in the euro crisis. Other Germans, mainly on the left, fret about a new “post-post-nationalism”, as Germany tentatively articulates its self-interest abroad. For most countries, this would count as normal. For Germany, it remains complicated.
