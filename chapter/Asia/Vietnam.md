# 越南换届

>国家在快速发展，它的领导人却原地踏步

2016-01-16 河内

越南首都，河内市中心，一家时髦的咖啡店上放置着鲜红的共产主义红星标志。

在店内，红砖墙上展示着越南战争时期的纪念品：生锈的餐具，一个老式晶体管收音机和越共士兵赶赴与美国人战斗的照片。

与其说是爱国主义审美，不如说是基于共产主义意识形态的粗陋包装。二三十岁的越南年轻人在这儿喝酒，享受着日益资本主义化的经济发展果实。他们远离艰难困苦的境遇，和父母和祖父母辈完全不同，与此同时，热烈支持与美国发展更佳紧密的关系。

在越南年轻一代的的驱动下，经济每年以接近7%的速度增长，越南看起来像一个行色匆匆的国家。

在许多方面，执政的共产党试图跟上发展的步伐。距离咖啡店不远，有一栋装饰华丽的教堂式窗户的新建筑－越南国家议会。

阳光从天窗映入大理石门厅。在一党制国家，符号能透露很多信息，这栋建筑的通风设计表明，统治者试图构建一个现代、透明的形象。

本月党内大佬将做出一个新的重大选择。
1月20日，他们将召开5年一度的代表大会，越南政治日历最重要的时刻。

党的执行理事会－16人组成的政治局，有超过一半的人注定将退休，被更年轻的官员取而代之。

该国三个最高级别职位－国家主席，政府总理和党中央总书记－全部虚位以待。

随着这一事件的到来，许多神秘迹象表明，今年的谈判气氛异常紧张。

值得关注的人是阮晋勇，已任职10年的越南政府总理，可以说是最精明、最缺乏领袖魅力的政治家。

66岁的阮先生已经超过了越共通常的退休年龄。

但是他已经放话说希望在高层留任－担任党的总书记，与此同时放弃他目前的职位以留个盟友。

阮先生无疑将重新获得一份工作，近期这些动作已经掀起一地鸡毛。

他或许希望开创性地获得一种支配性的权力－接近于中国的习近平已经享有的。


但是这样的动作将是非比寻常的。
它将扰乱政治制度，到目前为止，压制了领导者个人的专横跋扈，它也是获得各界认可的共识。

阮先生的支持者宣称：越南目前的挑战需要强有力的、持续一致的领导。

迫切需要修复经济，国有企业的坏账问题已经威胁银行系统。国家将从2015年签订的一系列贸易协定中获益，包括美国主导的跨太平洋伙伴关系。

然而许多重要的改革一直进展缓慢，包括国有企业私有化。

经济过度依赖特定几种商品，特别是咖啡、大米，以及外国投资者。

越南的经济必须扩大和深化改革，当它现在的最大优势－年轻和廉价的劳动力，耗尽之前。

至于政治领域，管理与中国棘手的外交关系是最大的挑战。

越南在经济上高度依赖它的北方邻国，它具有一个巨大而且日益增长的贸易逆差。

与此同时，中国在南中国海争议地区，申索岛屿和海底资源的行为，甚至已经引起温和的越南人的愤慨。

从1980年代该国开始抛弃计划经济体制以来出生的人，更加直言不讳，例如在社交媒体上。

越南无法承受与中国关系恶化的后果，但是同时它的领导人也必须让人民看到维护越南领土的作为。

争斗中的雪貂
大部分知识分子，在关注党代表大会时，乐见阮先生保留部分权力，自从他被视为对抗中国恃强凌弱的最强音。

尽管出于不同的原因，他也是本地人和外国商人的明确选择。

他们看到阮先生在一系列贸易协定、提高外资所有权比例等方面做出的努力。他们说他非常了解产业界，重视受过西方教育的人才，清楚投资者想要听到什么。

然而，与他的其他同志一样，总理身上也有任人唯亲的丑闻。

他儿子的政治生涯有着令人怀疑、超乎寻常的晋升，而一位浮华的越南裔美国籍女婿，持有该国的麦当劳特许经营权。

在阮先生曾大力倡导的国有企业中，丑闻也已经萌发。

更不用说，在解禁审查管制和结束暴力对待不同政见者方面，民主自由主义者认为他与其他领导人没什么区别。

随着党代表大会的临近，结果变得更加不确定。

阮先生曾经一度被认为可以稳当地成为党的领袖。

然而一个针对他的、松散的反对联盟，也许正试图将他完全地踢出领导层。

这场争斗的源头部分来自对人事权的争夺，也有部分来自，保守派和总理的相对倾向改革的盟友之间，在意识形态方面的分歧。

一些官员担心，越南和美国日益亲密的关系将会激怒中国。他们中的少数人，甚至担心阮先生的自由化本能，最终将威胁到党对权力的控制。

但这些都只是猜想。

相对于阳光普照的新国会大厦，越南共产党依然是一只在黑暗袋子里的雪貂。


故事真的结束了吗
Vietnam’s Communist Party

Changing of the guard—but then again, perhaps not

The country is in a hurry; its leaders less so

Jan 16th 2016 | HANOI

THE sign above the door at Cong Caphe, a hip coffee shop in downtown Hanoi, the Vietnamese capital, bears a bright-red communist star. Inside, the brick walls are covered in memorabilia from the era of the Vietnam war: rusty canteens, an old transistor radio and snapshots of Viet Cong soldiers trudging off to fight the Americans. Yet the aesthetic is not so much patriotic as a cheeky send-up of communist ideology. The 20- and 30-something Vietnamese who drink here, spending the fruits of an increasingly capitalist economy, feel far removed from the hardships suffered by their parents and grandparents, while they applaud ever-closer ties with America.

With its scooter-driving young and an economy growing at nearly 7% a year, Vietnam seems like a country in a hurry. In many ways, the ruling Communist Party is trying to keep up. Not far from the coffee shop, windows the size of a cathedral’s illuminate the new building housing the National Assembly, Vietnam’s parliament. Sunbeams pour from skylights into the marble foyer. In a one-party state where symbols matter, the building’s airiness suggests that the rulers are trying to project an image of modernity and transparency. Yet as Nguyen Vu Nam, a manager at Cong Caphe, points out, young Vietnamese do not pay much heed to who runs the party. Personnel changes among a generally grey and faceless collective leadership have never seemed to matter much.

This month party bigwigs will make a fresh bid for relevance. On January 20th they convene for a five-yearly congress, the highlight of Vietnam’s political calendar. More than half of the 16-member Politburo, the party’s ruling council, are meant to retire, to be replaced by younger officials. The country’s three most senior jobs—of state president, prime minister and party general secretary—are all up for grabs. That so much remains mysterious so close to the event suggests that this year’s negotiations are unusually tense.

The man to watch is Nguyen Tan Dung, Vietnam’s prime minister for ten years and probably its shrewdest and least uncharismatic politician. At 66, Mr Dung is past the party’s usual retirement age. But he is said to want to remain in high office by taking the role of party secretary, while perhaps relinquishing his current office to an ally. Mr Dung would doubtless reinvigorate a job which has lately begun to look dusty. He may wish to carve out an authority that begins to approach the dominance enjoyed by Xi Jinping in China. But such a move would be unusual. It would rattle a political system which, until now, has discouraged domineering personalities and has valued consensus.

Mr Dung’s backers say that Vietnam’s present challenges call for strong and consistent leadership. The economy is much mended after bad debts from cosseted state enterprises threatened the banking system. The country stands to gain from a sheaf of trade agreements negotiated in 2015, including the American-led Trans-Pacific Partnership. Yet progress towards many essential reforms, including the privatisation of state firms, has been slow. The economy is overdependent on commodities, especially coffee and rice, as well as on foreign investors. It will be essential to broaden and deepen Vietnam’s economy before its biggest present advantage, a young and cheap workforce, is spent.

As for politics, managing the country’s tricky relations with China is the biggest challenge. Vietnam is economically dependent on its northern neighbour, with which it has a big and growing trade deficit. At the same time, China’s assertive claims to islands and underwater resources in contested parts of the South China Sea have outraged even moderate Vietnamese. Those born since the country ditched its planned economy in the 1980s are growing more outspoken, for example on social media. Vietnam cannot afford to have bad relations with China, but at the same time its leaders must be seen to be defending Vietnamese territory.

Fighting ferrets

Most intellectuals paying attention to the party congress would like to see Mr Dung retain some authority, since he has been the strongest voice against Chinese bullying. He is also the clear choice among local and foreign business folk, though for different reasons. They see Mr Dung as behind the flurry of trade deals and recent efforts to lift caps on foreign ownership. They say he is unusually knowledgeable about industry, well-advised by Western-educated staff and knows what investors want to hear.

Yet whiffs of cronyism taint the prime minister as much as they do other comrades. His son’s political career has seen suspiciously swift advancement, while a flashy Vietnamese-American son-in-law owns the country’s McDonald’s franchise. Scandals have sprouted at state enterprises that Mr Dung had championed. Nor do civil libertarians think that he is more inclined than other leaders to unshackle the censored press or end the thuggish treatment of dissidents.

As the party congress approaches, its outcome appears ever less certain. Mr Dung was once thought a shoo-in for party leader. Yet a loose-knit faction opposed to him may even manage to oust him entirely from the leadership.

The fighting springs partly from competing networks of patronage, and partly from modest ideological differences between conservatives and the prime minister’s relatively reformist pals. Some officials worry that Vietnam’s growing chumminess with America will only make China more confrontational. A handful of them even seem to fret that Mr Dung’s liberalising instincts could end up threatening the party’s hold on power. But that would be conjecture. For all the light streaming into the new parliament building, Vietnam’s Communist Party remains a dark sack full of ferrets.
