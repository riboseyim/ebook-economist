难民是绝望处境中的理性人。
对于许多迟来的寻求庇护者—从叙利亚，伊拉克，阿富汗和其它遭受战争蹂躏国家逃往欧洲，过去一年的日子变得可怕。
欧洲和平，富裕而且容易到达。大部分人并不会为了这些放弃家园，在陌生人中重新开始生活。
不过如果面对生命威胁—桶爆弹和挥舞利刃的狂热份子，他们只能作出唯一合理的选择。

难民流本来可以变成可控的—如果欧盟国家过去能够一起努力，正如德国总理 Angela Merkel过去希望的那样(也是 Economist 强烈希望的)。实际上是德国和瑞士脱离欧盟其它国家单独行动。今天他们已经为此精疲力竭。
除非欧洲可以很快恢复秩序，政治上的压力将迫使默克尔女士单方面采取遏制措施，开始一些列关闭边境的行动。
更令人担忧的是，移民危机已经使仇外心理和政治上的民粹主义大肆扩张。

右翼民族主义分裂势力已经在东欧部分地区崛起。如果他们向西扩张到德国，法国和意大利，欧盟将分崩离析。

现在的形势一团糟。
难民已经可以自由横渡地中海，并且视忽哪些国家受欢迎而注册登记。许多没有申请庇护权利的经济移民，通过隐匿出发国的方式进入了队伍中。这种自由放任的方案必须被一种筛选机制替代—确认申请人是第一次到达欧洲边界，或者更好的是，在他们横渡地中海之前采取措施。那些不具备庇护资格的人应该立即遣返；那些具备资格的人应该被送往有意愿接收他们的国家。

边境秩序

建立一套井然有序的边境系统需要分三步走。
第一步：遏制鼓励人们冒险穿越的舆论，减少“推波助澜因素”的影响，主要通过加强难民援助的方式，
特别是叙利亚和伊拉克内战的受害者，包括数量庞大、已经逃往邻国土耳其、约旦和黎巴嫩的人群。

第二步：针对仍滞留在中心区域－中东和“热点”（主要在希腊和意大利）寻求庇护的难民，当他们第一次到达欧洲的时候监测他们的去向。

第三步：就地安置寻求庇护者，直到申请通过，而不是让他们跳上通往德国的火车。

所有这些步骤都面临巨大的挑战。就拿“推波助澜因素”来说。
结束叙利亚内战的前景一如既往的遥远：本周在日内瓦召开的停战和平谈判没有取得任何进展。
但是欧盟应该采取更多的措施来帮助难民和他们的东道国。
骇人听闻的是，即使战争变得更加血腥，2015年针对叙利亚的援助元素仍被削减：援助机构从联合国只获得了他们去年所需的一半多一点。 
本周在伦敦举办的叙利亚捐助者会议为2016年申请了90亿美金的预算－差不多相当于德国人每年在巧克力上的花销。
现在至未来每年需要比现在多得多的援助资金。
欧洲的资金不仅需要用在为难民提供食物和住所，也还应该用来引导东道国允许他们工作。
叙利亚战争的头四年，土耳其，约旦和黎巴嫩拒绝给予难民工作许可。
最近土耳其已经开始解禁。援助国应当敦促约旦和黎巴嫩采取同样的措施。
欧洲的资金可以为土耳其境内的400000无法接受教育的难民儿童提供支持。


有时答案是：不行

下一个问题是要求申请庇护者进行注册，并且尽可能按照距家乡就近原则排队，可能是土耳其，黎巴嫩 和 约旦。

理想情况下，那些驾着小船到达欧洲的人将被遣返到上述三个国家的难民营—为了证明他们付给人贩子进行的是一场毫无意义的旅行，只会浪费自己的积蓄。

但是这些措施将面临法律和政治上的反对，部分原因是出于土耳其恶劣的人权纪录。
所以，他们到达欧洲的第一站也应当设置难民营，也许是希腊或者意大利。

这项花费应该由欧盟所有国家分摊，其目标是为了加强它们外部边界的控制。
撮合这项交易时可能的。
作为在其国土上安置大量难民和营地的交换条件，希腊应该在其债务和预算方面获得帮助，它长期致力于解决自己的经济危机。

只有当他们确信，诚实的申请可以在合理的时间内被受理，难民才会接受这个方案（而不是非法穿越欧盟）。
所以欧盟需要花费精力，迅速处理他们的申请。成员国应该同意接受大量善意的庇护申请者。
一些难民也许会觉得去德国，法国会更好—还有一点是阻止他们穿越边境，一旦他们到达申根区。
但是，如果他们能获得良好的照顾，大多数人将留在原地。

这场危机需要一个更宏大的安置解决方案而不仅是依靠联合国难民署，它仅能容纳160000人。
欧盟之外的国家，包括海湾国家，能发挥他们的作用。应当优先处理目前仍滞留在土耳其，约旦和黎巴嫩的难民避难申请—用以减少难民偷渡到希腊的诱因。

非法移民将不得不被拒绝入境或驱逐出境。
这项措施在执法层面上存在困难，并且将人遣返回某些国家也是不现实的，例如叙利亚。但是如果这个机制不想被欧洲公民的口水吞没或者看起来不公平、不合法，排序方法就必须是高效和可执行的。
欧盟政府应该签署和实施安置协议以允许非法移民尽快回到家乡，或者摩洛哥、阿尔及利亚。
如果这项协议不可能达成（或者像巴基斯坦，政府无法兑现承诺），在希腊无限期等待的前景，将使经济移民们在去往德国之前犹豫。

一旦这些措施落实到位，将有望执行最具争议的步骤：禁止不受控制的难民潮穿越希腊北部和马其顿的边境。
在过去五个月的时间里，可以清楚的看到欧洲不能控制人数众多的难民潮，边境官员无法指挥寻求避难者，也不违法保障他们到达北欧的旅行安全。

当难民危机刚开始的时候，我们就主张欧洲应该欢迎遭受迫害的人民，同时对他们进入欧洲社会进行审慎地管理。
我们的主张没有改变。国家在道德和法律上有义务对那些逃离危险的人们提供庇护。
在短期看该方案具有破坏性，但是从中期看有益的，只要他们被允许工作，融入当地社会，养活自己。
与此相反的是，最近几个月的发生的混乱表明政治家未能采取一种泛欧洲的措施去应对一个显然是泛欧洲的问题。
我们提出的计划将需要大笔资金和一系列艰难的谈判。
但是它值得每个国家提供帮助—因为他们的处境将更加不利，如果欧盟错误的陷入一场排外的混战。

    
这里也有一个激励人心的成功先例。
1975年越共接管之后，超过一百万 “船民”逃离越南，被送往美国，欧洲，澳大利亚和其它接收地之前，他们起初进入香港和其它亚洲地区的难民营。
他们抵达目的地的时候一无所有但是适应的速度非常惊人：以越南裔美国人收入的中位数为例，现在已经高于美国国家平均水平。
现在美国没有一个人觉得船民无法融入当地社会。







A plan for Europe’s refugees
How to manage the migrant crisis
A European problem demands a common, coherent EU policy. Let refugees in, but regulate the flow

REFUGEES are reasonable people in desperate circumstances. Life for many of the 1m-odd asylum-seekers who have fled Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and other war-torn countries for Europe in the past year has become intolerable. Europe is peaceful, rich and accessible. Most people would rather not abandon their homes and start again among strangers. But when the alternative is the threat of death from barrel-bombs and sabre-wielding fanatics, they make the only rational choice.
The flow of refugees would have been manageable if European Union countries had worked together, as Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, has always wished (and The Economist urged). Instead Germany and Sweden have been left to cope alone. Today their willingness to do so is exhausted. Unless Europe soon restores order, political pressure will force Mrs Merkel to clamp down unilaterally, starting a wave of border closures (see article). More worrying, the migrant crisis is feeding xenophobia and political populism. The divisive forces of right-wing nationalism have already taken hold in parts of eastern Europe. If they spread westward into Germany, France and Italy then the EU could tear itself apart.

The situation today is a mess. Refugees have been free to sail across the Mediterranean, register and make for whichever country seems most welcoming. Many economic migrants with no claim to asylum have found a place in the queue by lying about where they came from. This free-for-all must be replaced by a system in which asylum applicants are screened when they first reach Europe’s borders—or better still, before they cross the Mediterranean. Those who are ineligible for asylum should be sent back without delay; those likely to qualify should be sent on to countries willing to accept them.




Order on the border
Creating a well-regulated system requires three steps. The first is to curb the “push factors” that encourage people to risk the crossing, by beefing up aid to refugees, particularly to the victims of the civil wars in Syria and Iraq, including the huge number who have fled to neighbouring countries such as Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon. The second is to review asylum claims while refugees are still in centres in the Middle East or in the “hotspots” (mainly in Greece and Italy), where they go when they first arrive in the EU. The third element is to insist that asylum-seekers stay put until their applications are processed, rather than jumping on a train to Germany.
All these steps are fraught with difficulty. Consider the “push factors” first. The prospect of ending Syria’s civil war is as remote as ever: peace talks in Geneva this week were suspended without progress. But the EU could do a lot more to help refugees and their host countries. Scandalously, aid for Syrians was cut in 2015 even as the war grew bloodier: aid agencies got a bit more than half of what they needed last year, according to the UN. Donors at a conference on Syria in London this week were asked for $9 billion for 2016—about as much as Germans spend on chocolate every year. Far more is needed and will be needed every year for several years.
Europe’s money should be used not only to feed and house refugees but also to coax host countries into letting them work. For the first four years of the conflict Syrians were denied work permits in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon. Recently Turkey has begun to grant them. Donors should press Jordan and Lebanon to follow. European cash could help teach the 400,000 refugee children in Turkey who have no classes.
Sometimes the answer is no
The next task is to require asylum-seekers to register and be sorted as close to home as possible, probably Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. Ideally those who travelled by boat to Europe would be sent back to a camp in one of those three countries—to prove that they had just wasted their precious savings paying people-traffickers to take them on a pointless journey. But that would meet legal and political objections, partly because of Turkey’s human-rights record (see our special report this week). So, there should also be processing camps in the first EU country they reach, probably Greece or Italy.
The cost of this should fall on the whole EU, since the aim is to establish control over its external borders. Dealmaking is possible. In exchange for hosting large refugee hotspots and camps on its soil, Greece should get help with its debt and budgets which it has long sought to ease its economic crisis.


INTERACTIVE: A guide to Europe’s migrant crisis, in numbers
Refugees will fall in with this scheme (rather than cross the EU illegally) only if they are confident that genuine applications will be accepted within a reasonable time. So the EU needs to spend what it takes to sort through their claims swiftly. And member states ought to agree to accept substantial numbers of bona fide asylum claimants. Some refugees may prefer Germany to, say, France—and there is little to stop them crossing borders once they are inside the Schengen area. But, if they are properly looked after, most will stay put.
The crisis needs a bigger resettlement programme than the one run by the UN’s refugee agency, which has only 160,000 spaces. Countries outside the EU, including the Gulf states, can play their part. Priority should go to refugees who apply for asylum while still in Turkey, Jordan or Lebanon—to reduce the incentive for refugees to board leaky boats to Greece.
Ineligible migrants will have to be refused entry or deported. This will be legally difficult, and it is impossible to repatriate people to some countries, such as Syria. But if the system is not to be overwhelmed or seen as unfair and illegitimate by EU citizens, the sorting must be efficient and enforceable. EU governments should sign and implement readmission agreements allowing rejected migrants to be sent home quickly to, say, Morocco or Algeria. If such agreements are impossible (or if, as with Pakistan, governments fail to honour them), the prospect of waiting indefinitely in Greece will make economic migrants who want to reach Germany hesitate before coming.
Once these measures are in place, it will become possible to take the most controversial step: halting the uncontrolled migrant flow across Greece’s northern border with Macedonia. It has become clear over the past five months that Europe cannot gain control over the numbers or the nature of the migrant stream while border officials wave asylum-seekers through and bid them safe travel to northern Europe.
Since the start of the refugee crisis, we have argued that Europe should welcome persecuted people and carefully manage their entry into European society. Our views have not changed. Countries have a moral and legal duty to provide sanctuary to those who flee grave danger. That approach is disruptive in the short term, but in the medium term, so long as they are allowed to work, refugees assimilate and more than pay for themselves. By contrast, the chaos of recent months shows what happens when politicians fail to take a pan-European approach to what is clearly a pan-European problem. The plan we outline would require a big chunk of cash and a lot of testy negotiations. But it is in every country’s interest to help—because all of them would be worse off if the EU lapses into a xenophobic free-for-all.
There is an encouraging precedent, too. When more than 1m “boat people” fled Vietnam after the communists took over in 1975, they went initially to refugee camps in Hong Kong and other parts of Asia before being sent to America, Europe, Australia and wherever else would take them. They arrived with nothing but adapted astonishingly fast: the median household income for Vietnamese-Americans, for example, is now above the national average. No one in America now frets that the boat people will not fit in.
